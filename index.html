  <h4><strong>About Me</strong></h4>
  <p>Originally from Denver, I am now fortunate to call San Diego my home. The beaches here are unbeatable - on the weekends, you can find me enjoying the sun and ocean while hanging out with friends. I enrolled in Epicodus to jumpstart my career in tech and gain practical skills through hands-on learning and project-based work. I believe that Epicodus will give me the knowledge, experience, and support I need to succeed in the industry</p>
